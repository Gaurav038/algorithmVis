# Algorithm Visualizer

This is a progressive web app built using React.js to visualize  algorithms such as bubble, insertion, selection, merge, quick, heap and twist sort. This app is deployed with GitHub pages and can be accessed here: [Link] ----------. I hope you have fun playing around with it.

```

## Purpose

I wanted to improve my skills with React.js, JavaScript, CSS and also learn sorting algorithms.This project turned out to be a great way to achieve both of the aforementioned objectives at the same time.



## Algorithms implemented 


- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Heap sort
