# Algorithm Visualizer

This is a progressive web app built using React.js to visualize  algorithms such as bubble, insertion, selection, merge, quick, heap and many more . This app is deployed with Netlify and can be accessed here: [https://lucky-begonia-b6285c.netlify.app/#/] ----------. I hope you have fun playing around with it.

## Installation and Setup Instructions

Installation:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Gaurav038/algorithmVis.git
$ cd algorithmVis
$ npm install
```
To start server:
```
$ npm start
```
To Visit App in any browser:
```
http://localhost:3000/
```

## Purpose

I wanted to improve my skills with React.js, JavaScript, CSS and also learn sorting algorithms.This project turned out to be a great way to achieve both of the aforementioned objectives at the same time.



## Algorithms implemented 


- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Heap sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort

- Sieve of Eratosthenes

- N Queen Backtracking

- Binary Search
